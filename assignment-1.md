# Project Proposal 

## Stadium Spectacle
Stadium Spectacle is a project intending to shed light on the impacts of publicly funded stadium development in the United States on the makeup of neighborhoods surrounding the stadiums. This will be achieved by examining a few case study stadiums. The stadiums selected are Tmobile Arena in Seattle, Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, the San Jose SAP Center, and the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.

### Camille Wong
Camille is a first year MFA student in the Design Media Arts Department within the School of the Arts and Architecture. They hold B.A.s in Art and Environmental Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara. They are a research-based artist invested in finding invisible dynamics of power embedded in technologies, social infrastructures, and the built environment. Their approach spans interactive websites, experimental video, sculpture, and writing, to reveal the extensive influence of power obscured within the texture of social spaces. Drawing from disciplines within digital humanities, urbanism, and experimental geography, their work observes how humans produce that space that in turn, shapes them.

## Overview
This project opens an investigation across publicly-funded stadiums in the United States under the four major professional sport leagues––the NBA, NFL, MLB, and NHL. With case studies on three major US stadiums: the Safeco/Tmobile Arena in Seattle, Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, the San Jose SAP Center, and the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, this project will follow the historical neighborhoods these stadiums were built in to chart their impact on the surrounding environment. It will ask not only how stadiums affect the demographics of the neighborhood––including race, property value, and median income, but also interrogate the sites of their construction. The purpose of this project is to analyze the neighborhood in which a stadium is built and the economic implications of public subsidies on professional sport facilities. Our method involves comparing Census data (U.S. Census Bureau) and The Home Owners’ Loan Corporation Redlining Grade Map. This detailed analysis will illustrate the long-term effects of housing segregation in the United States and critically examine the redirection of taxpayer-backed bonds on sports stadiums. 

## Methodology
The web map will show the different locations of each stadium while simultaneously providing information on the impact of its construction within the region. The utilization of mapping will allow for a clear and concise analysis of the stadiums based on their location.
