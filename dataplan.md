# Data Plan

We plan on using the datasets provided by the [U.S. Census website](https://www.census.gov/data.html); since we plan on downloading data for 4 cities across a 10 year period, it's not convinent listing all 80 (2 topics!) links. We've already downloaded our datasets and they can be accessed through this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bDz7yzGR7vllpy-Pe6puVagO8zjIkBpg?usp=sharing).

We used the data.census.gov (https://www.census.gov/data.html) website to accumulate data. We narrowed down our selection through 2 topics: Housing Value and Earnings from the Past 12 Months. We are interested in these variables because we wonder if the housing prices and the income of the individuals living within the neighborhoods surrounding the stadiums differ from the other neighborhoods within these cities. The housing data lists how many homes within a given zip code fall within a given range of value (e.g., $10,000-$14,999 or over $1 million). The income data lists the median income between males and females within a given zip cop.

We also limited our geographic scope to zip codes within the cities of interest. Due to some limitations of the Census website, we were unable to find data prior to 2011; hence, our datasets are limited to 2011-2020 data. The data has been downloaded as CVS and Excel files and all datasets have been compiled into a shared folder. Data will be geocoded using javascript or python and the variables, specifically the “Housing Value” and “Earnings in the Last 12 Months” variables, will be categorized into different financial ranges. These categories will then be assigned a different hue of a color, and turned into choropleth maps depicting the range of housing values and earnings across each county that the stadiums are located in.
